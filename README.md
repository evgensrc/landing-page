## **Description**

This landing page is a learning project developed as part of the **[Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)** course by **[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)**.
Its goal is to demonstrate skills in creating responsive and semantically correct web pages using HTML and CSS. 
The project includes typical landing page sections: a hero block, informational cards, a quote, a call-to-action (CTA), and a footer. 
The design follows modern principles, such as a contrasting color scheme, readable typography, and a focus on usability. Landing is implemented using Flexbox for element alignment and responsive structure.
